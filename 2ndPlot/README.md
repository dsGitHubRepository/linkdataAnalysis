# Analysis 1stplot

2nd part of the project analyzed the resources of the sites that was most popular or alternatively to say resources that was most 
frequently downloaded and ultimately the bandwidth calculation of top resources. The code analyzed N number of top resources and  
the corresponding bandwidth.  

# Insight

Though resource consumption depends on the popularity of the resources, resource consumption (byte transferred while 
downlaoding resources) over a large number of consumer is random event. As the number of users tend to infinity users' bandwidth 
distribution would tend to Normal distribution.


The plot of the resource bandwidth for top resources also shows an exponential decay taht predicts bandwidth distribution for large number 
of users' would tend to be a Normal distribution.

# Summary

The distribution of login activity count shows an exponential decrease that predicts users log acvity will exibit Normal distribution.
