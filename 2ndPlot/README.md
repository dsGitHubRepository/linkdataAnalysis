# Analysis 1stplot

2nd part of the project analyzed the resources of the sites interms of their popularity or alternatively frequently downloaded resources and ultimately the bandwidth calculation of top resources. The code analyzed N number of top resources and  the corresponding bandwidth.  

# Insight

Though resource consumption (byte transferred while downlaoding resources) depends on the popularity of the resources; resource consumption  over a large number of consumer is random event. As the number of users tend to be infinity, bandwidth distribution would tend to be Normal distribution.


# Summary

The plot of the resource bandwidth for top resources also shows an exponential decay that predicts bandwidth distribution for large number 
of users' would tend to be a Normal distribution.
